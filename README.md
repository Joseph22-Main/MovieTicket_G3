Overview
This project is a fully-featured Movie Ticketing System built with C# and WPF. It provides a robust, user-friendly interface for customers to browse movies, select showtimes, book seats in one of five theaters, and purchase snacks.

For administrators, the system includes a powerful backend dashboard that allows for complete control over the cinema's operations, including movie and user management, showtime scheduling, and dynamic price adjustments for both tickets and snacks. The application is architected to be scalable and maintainable, with a clear separation between the user-facing client and the administrative backend.
